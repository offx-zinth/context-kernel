# Context Agent Module (context_agent.py) - The "Prefrontal Cortex"

# 1. Purpose of the file/module:
# This module represents the "prefrontal cortex" or central executive of the
# ContextKernel AI system. It is responsible for high-level cognitive tasks,
# primarily:
#   - Understanding semantic intent from incoming user queries, system events,
#     or other forms of raw input.
#   - Making decisions about how to handle the input.
#   - Routing tasks to the appropriate specialized modules within the kernel
#     (e.g., LLM-Retriever for fetching information, LLM-Listener for processing
#     and storing new information, or other custom tools/plugins).
#   - Orchestrating the flow of information and control between different components.
#   - Potentially managing conversation state and context over multiple turns.

# 2. Core Logic:
# The core logic of the Context Agent typically involves several stages:
#   - Input Processing: Receiving and pre-processing input (e.g., text cleaning,
#     basic parsing).
#   - Intent Detection: Analyzing the input to determine the underlying goal or
#     purpose. This can range from simple keyword matching to sophisticated
#     NLP-based classification using machine learning models.
#   - Parameter Extraction: Identifying key entities or parameters within the input
#     that are necessary for fulfilling the intent (e.g., dates, names, locations,
#     specific search terms).
#   - Routing Decision: Based on the detected intent and extracted parameters,
#     the agent decides which module, tool, or workflow is best suited to handle
#     the request. This can be driven by a rules engine, a trained model, or a
#     hybrid approach.
#   - Task Dispatching: Formulating a task or instruction for the selected module
#     and dispatching it. This might involve transforming the input into a format
#     expected by the target module.
#   - Response Handling (Optional): It might receive a response from the dispatched
#     module and decide on further actions, or directly formulate a response to
#     the original input source.
#   - Orchestration: Managing the sequence of operations if multiple modules need
#     to be invoked to fulfill a complex request.

# 3. Key Inputs/Outputs:
#   - Inputs:
#     - User Queries: Natural language text from users (e.g., chat messages, search queries).
#     - System Events: Notifications or data from other parts of the system or
#       external services.
#     - Structured Data: Potentially, inputs could also be more structured commands or API calls.
#     - Current Context: Information about the ongoing interaction or state.
#   - Outputs:
#     - Dispatched Tasks: Instructions or calls to other modules within the ContextKernel
#       (e.g., a query for the LLMRetriever, data for the LLMListener to process).
#     - Direct Responses: In some cases, the Context Agent might generate a direct
#       response to the user (e.g., an acknowledgement, a clarification question).
#     - Updated Context/State: Modifications to the conversational or system state.

# 4. Dependencies/Needs:
#   - LLM Models: Access to language models for tasks like intent detection,
#     entity extraction, query understanding, or even for making routing decisions.
#   - Interfaces to Core Logic Modules: Mechanisms to call and pass data to
#     `LLMRetriever`, `LLMListener`, memory systems, and any custom tools/plugins.
#   - Configuration:
#     - Routing Rules/Models: Definitions for how intents map to modules.
#     - LLM model configurations (e.g., API keys, model names).
#   - Memory System: Access to STM/LTM to retrieve context that might inform
#     intent detection or routing.

# 5. Real-world solutions/enhancements:

#   Intent Detection Libraries/Techniques:
#   - spaCy: For rule-based matching (e.g., using `Matcher`, `PhraseMatcher`),
#     dependency parsing, NER, and text classification for simpler intent models.
#     (https://spacy.io/)
#   - NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Provides tools for text processing, classification,
#     and other NLP tasks. (https://www.nltk.org/)
#   - Transformer-based Models (Hugging Face):
#     - Zero-shot/Few-shot Classification: Use models like BART or T5 fine-tuned on NLI
#       (Natural Language Inference) to classify intent with few or no examples.
#     - Fine-tuned Models: Fine-tune models like BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT on a specific
#       intent recognition dataset for higher accuracy.
#     (https://huggingface.co/transformers/)
#   - Rasa NLU: Open-source framework specifically for intent recognition and entity
#     extraction in conversational AI. (https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/nlu-training-data/)
#   - Scikit-learn: For traditional ML approaches to intent classification (e.g., SVM,
#     Logistic Regression on TF-IDF features).

#   Routing Strategies:
#   - Rule-based Routing: Define explicit `IF intent THEN module` rules. Can be implemented
#     with simple conditional logic or dedicated rules engines.
#     - Example: `IF intent == "get_weather" AND "location" in entities THEN route_to_weather_tool`.
#   - Model-based Routing: Train a classification model where the input is the query/context
#     and the output classes are the target modules or tools.
#   - Hybrid Approach: Use rules for common, well-defined intents and a model for more
#     ambiguous cases or for selecting among multiple potentially relevant tools.
#   - Cost-based Routing: If multiple modules can handle a request, route based on factors
#     like predicted latency, computational cost, or reliability.

#   Orchestration Analogies & Tools:
#   - API Gateways (e.g., Kong, Apigee, AWS API Gateway): Manage and route incoming API
#     requests to backend services, similar to how the agent routes tasks.
#   - Workflow Orchestrators (e.g., Apache Airflow, Prefect, Camunda, AWS Step Functions):
#     Define, schedule, and monitor complex workflows involving multiple steps/tasks.
#     The Context Agent could be seen as a dynamic, AI-driven orchestrator.
#   - Business Process Management (BPM) Engines: Software for modeling, executing, and
#     monitoring business processes, which often involve routing and decision logic.

#   State Management:
#   - If handling multi-turn conversations, the Context Agent needs to manage conversation
#     state (e.g., previous turns, user context, active goals).
#   - This state can be stored in an STM (e.g., Redis) or passed around.
#   - State information is crucial for resolving anaphora, understanding follow-up
#     questions, and maintaining coherent interactions.

#   Learning/Adaptive Routing:
#   - Reinforcement Learning: The agent could learn optimal routing strategies over time
#     based on feedback (e.g., task success, user satisfaction).
#   - Feedback Loops: Incorporate feedback on the quality or relevance of module outputs
#     to refine routing rules or retrain routing models.
