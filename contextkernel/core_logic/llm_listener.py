# LLM Listener Module (llm_listener.py) - Context Optimizer & Memory Writer

# 1. Purpose of the file/module:
# This module acts as the "Context Optimizer" and "Memory Writer" for the
# ContextKernel. Its primary responsibilities are:
#   - Processing new information: This information might come from user interactions,
#     external data feeds, or be identified by the Context Agent as a "context gap."
#   - Summarization & Insight Extraction: Utilizing Language Models (LLMs) to condense,
#     summarize, or extract key insights, entities, and relationships from the
#     processed information.
#   - Context Refinement: Enriching the information by linking it to existing knowledge,
#     disambiguating entities, or adding relevant metadata.
#   - Structuring Data: Transforming the refined insights into a structured format
#     suitable for storage in the kernel's memory systems.
#   - Writing to Memory: Interacting with the various memory components (STM, LTM,
#     GraphDB, RawCache) to save these structured insights, effectively building and
#     updating the kernel's knowledge base.

# 2. Core Logic:
# The LLM Listener's workflow typically involves:
#   - Receiving Data: Input data can be raw text, documents, conversation snippets,
#     or pointers to data that needs processing. This might be triggered by the
#     Context Agent or an external event.
#   - Pre-processing (Optional): Cleaning or preparing the data for LLM interaction.
#   - LLM Interaction for Insight Generation:
#     - Summarization: Using an LLM to create concise summaries (extractive or abstractive).
#     - Entity/Keyword Extraction: Identifying key people, places, topics, concepts.
#     - Relation Extraction: Discovering relationships between identified entities.
#     - Question Answering: Potentially asking questions about the text to extract specific facts.
#   - Data Structuring: Organizing the extracted insights. This might involve:
#     - Defining schemas or models (e.g., using Pydantic) for different types of information.
#     - Formatting data for graph databases (nodes, edges, properties).
#     - Preparing data for vector embedding (if not already embedded).
#   - Memory System Interaction:
#     - Deciding which memory tier(s) are appropriate for the structured insights
#       (e.g., raw data to RawCache, embeddings and text to LTM, entities and
#       relationships to GraphDB, frequently accessed summaries to STM).
#     - Calling the respective memory module interfaces to save the data.
#   - (Optional) Feedback Loop: Potentially providing feedback to the Context Agent
#     or other components about the outcome of the processing.

# 3. Key Inputs/Outputs:
#   - Inputs:
#     - Raw or Semi-processed Data: Text, documents, user conversation logs, API responses.
#     - Instructions/Context from Context Agent: Guidance on what to process, what kind
#       of insights to look for, or how to prioritize.
#     - Configuration: Parameters for LLM interaction (e.g., summarization length,
#       model choice), data structuring rules.
#   - Outputs:
#     - Structured Data written to Memory: No direct return value to the caller typically,
#       but side effects in the form of data written to STM, LTM, GraphDB, RawCache.
#     - Updates to GraphDB: New nodes and relationships representing the learned knowledge.
#     - Log Messages: Information about the processing and storage operations.

# 4. Dependencies/Needs:
#   - LLM Models: Access to LLMs, particularly those proficient in summarization
#     (e.g., BART, T5, Pegasus), question answering, and general text understanding.
#   - Memory System Interfaces: Python APIs to interact with `GraphDB.py`, `LTM.py`,
#     `STM.py`, and `RawCache.py`.
#   - Configuration: Settings for LLM API keys, model names, summarization parameters
#     (length, style, abstractive/extractive), data storage policies.
#   - Data Processing Libraries: For text manipulation, NER, keyword extraction if
#     not solely relying on a single LLM call.

# 5. Real-world solutions/enhancements:

#   Summarization Libraries/Models:
#   - Hugging Face Transformers:
#     - Abstractive Models: `facebook/bart-large-cnn`, `google/pegasus-xsum`, `t5-base`.
#     - Extractive Summarization: Can be done by selecting important sentences using
#       sentence embeddings and clustering, or using models fine-tuned for extractive tasks.
#     (https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=summarization)
#   - Gensim: `summarize` function (TextRank algorithm for extractive summarization).
#     (https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/summarization/summariser.html)
#   - Sumy: Library with various extractive summarization methods (LexRank, Luhn, LSA).
#     (https://pypi.org/project/sumy/)

#   Context Refinement Techniques:
#   - Named Entity Recognition (NER):
#     - spaCy: `doc.ents` provides quick and efficient NER. (https://spacy.io/)
#     - Hugging Face Transformers: Use pre-trained NER models for higher accuracy or more entity types.
#   - Keyword/Keyphrase Extraction:
#     - YAKE!: Unsupervised keyword extraction. (https://pypi.org/project/yake/)
#     - KeyBERT: Uses BERT embeddings to find keywords similar to the document. (https://pypi.org/project/keybert/)
#     - TF-IDF based methods (e.g., from `scikit-learn`).
#   - Relation Extraction:
#     - Can be complex; may involve training custom models, using OpenNRE-style libraries,
#       or carefully crafting prompts for LLMs to output structured relationship data.
#   - Data Disambiguation: Linking extracted entities to canonical entries in a knowledge base.

#   Knowledge Base Integration:
#   - RDF Triples: Format extracted information (subject-predicate-object) for storage
#     in triple stores (e.g., Neo4j with RDF support, Apache Jena, GraphDB).
#     Example: `(Entity: "Paris", Property: "isCapitalOf", Value: "France")`.
#   - Ontology Updating: If a formal ontology exists, new instances or relationships
#     can be added. Tools like `rdflib` can be used to manipulate RDF data.
#   - Populating Graph Databases: Directly create nodes and edges in property graphs
#     like Neo4j using their Python drivers.

#   Data Structuring:
#   - Pydantic: Define Python classes that represent the schema for different types
#     of insights. This ensures data consistency before writing to memory.
#     (https://docs.pydantic.dev/)
#   - Standard Dataclasses: Python's built-in dataclasses can also be used for simpler structures.

#   Conditional Processing Logic:
#   - Develop rules or a model to decide:
#     - Which memory tier is most appropriate for a piece of information (e.g., raw logs
#       to RawCache, processed summaries to LTM, entities/relations to GraphDB).
#     - Whether information is novel enough to be stored or if it's redundant.
#     - The level of summarization or detail required based on source or type of info.
#   - Example: A brief user chat might only update STM and LTM, while ingesting a large
#     technical document might populate RawCache, LTM (chunked embeddings), and GraphDB
#     (extracted entities and concepts).
