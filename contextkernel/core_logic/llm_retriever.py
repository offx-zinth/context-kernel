# LLM Retriever Module (llm_retriever.py) - Long-Term Memory Searcher

# 1. Purpose of the file/module:
# This module acts as the "Long-Term Memory Searcher" or "Knowledge Retriever" for
# the ContextKernel. Its primary responsibility is to fetch relevant information
# from the kernel's various memory components (LTM, STM, GraphDB) in response to
# a query or information need, typically identified by the Context Agent.
# It employs techniques like semantic (vector) search and graph traversal to
# find the most pertinent data to fulfill the request.

# 2. Core Logic:
# The LLM Retriever's workflow generally involves:
#   - Receiving Retrieval Request: Gets a request, usually from the Context Agent,
#     containing a search query (natural language), a task description, or specific
#     parameters for retrieval.
#   - Query Understanding & Formulation:
#     - (Optional) Query Pre-processing/Expansion: Refining the input query, possibly using
#       an LLM to expand it with synonyms, related terms, or rephrase it for better
#       search performance.
#     - Embedding Generation: If the query is text and semantic search is to be performed,
#       the query is converted into a vector embedding using a suitable model.
#   - Memory Interaction:
#     - Semantic Search (LTM/STM): Queries vector stores (like those managed by `ltm.py`
#       or a caching layer in `stm.py`) using the query embedding to find documents or
#       data chunks with similar semantic content.
#     - Graph Traversal (GraphDB): Queries the knowledge graph (managed by `graph_db.py`)
#       to find entities, relationships, or subgraphs relevant to the query. This might
#       involve looking up entities found in the query or using relationships to navigate
#       to related information.
#     - (Optional) Keyword Search: May also interact with full-text search capabilities
#       if available in memory systems.
#   - Result Consolidation & Ranking:
#     - Aggregating results from different sources (e.g., vector search, graph search).
#     - Re-ranking the combined results based on relevance, recency, source reliability,
#       or a more sophisticated ranking model (e.g., a cross-encoder).
#   - Formatting Output: Preparing the retrieved data in a structured format that can be
#     easily consumed by the requesting module (e.g., the Context Agent or an LLM for
#     response generation).

# 3. Key Inputs/Outputs:
#   - Inputs:
#     - Search Query: Natural language text, keywords, or a specific question.
#     - Task Description: Broader context of what the retrieved information will be used for.
#     - Filters/Constraints: (Optional) Metadata filters (e.g., date ranges, source types,
#       user IDs), number of results to return (top-k).
#     - Query Embedding: (Optional) If the embedding is pre-computed.
#   - Outputs:
#     - Ranked List of Relevant Data: A list of documents, text chunks, graph snippets,
#       or other data structures deemed relevant to the input query.
#     - Associated Metadata: Source information, timestamps, relevance scores for each item.
#     - Context Package: The retrieved information, possibly summarized or synthesized,
#       ready to be used as context by other AI components.

# 4. Dependencies/Needs:
#   - LLM Models:
#     - For generating embeddings from textual queries.
#     - (Optional) For query understanding, expansion, or re-ranking.
#   - Vector Embedding Models: Access to specific models (e.g., Sentence Transformers,
#     OpenAI Ada, Cohere embeddings) to convert text to vectors.
#   - Memory System Interfaces: Python APIs to interact with `LTM.py` (vector stores),
#     `GraphDB.py` (graph database), and potentially `STM.py` (cache).
#   - Configuration: Settings for vector database connections, graph database connections,
#     default top-k values, embedding model choices.

# 5. Real-world solutions/enhancements:

#   Semantic Search Libraries/Vector Databases:
#   - FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): Library for efficient vector similarity search.
#     (https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)
#   - Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): From Spotify, good for large-scale ANN.
#     (https://github.com/spotify/annoy)
#   - ScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): Google's library for efficient vector search.
#     (https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/scann)
#   - Managed Vector Databases: Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, Qdrant, ChromaDB, Vespa.
#     These offer full database solutions with SDKs.
#   - Frameworks: Haystack (https://haystack.deepset.ai/) provides an end-to-end solution
#     integrating many of these vector search technologies with reader/generator models.

#   Vector Embedding Models:
#   - Sentence Transformers (SBERT): Wide range of pre-trained models for sentence/text embeddings.
#     (https://www.sbert.net/)
#   - OpenAI Embeddings API (e.g., `text-embedding-ada-002`).
#   - Cohere Embed API.
#   - Custom Trained Embeddings: Fine-tuning embedding models on domain-specific data.

#   Graph Traversal & Querying:
#   - NetworkX: For in-memory graph operations if a portion of the graph is loaded locally.
#     (https://networkx.org/)
#   - Query Languages for Graph DBs:
#     - Cypher: For Neo4j. (https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/)
#     - Gremlin: For Apache TinkerPop-compatible databases (e.g., JanusGraph, Amazon Neptune).
#       (https://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html)
#     - SPARQL: For RDF triple stores. (https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/)

#   Hybrid Search Strategies:
#   - Combining Semantic and Keyword Search: Use traditional keyword search (e.g., BM25
#     from Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, or libraries like `rank_bm25`) to find exact matches,
#     and semantic search for conceptual similarity.
#   - Re-ranking:
#     - Use simpler, faster methods for initial retrieval from a large corpus.
#     - Then, use a more powerful (but slower) model, like a cross-encoder (e.g., from
#       Sentence Transformers), to re-rank the top N results for better precision.
#   - Fusion Algorithms: Techniques like Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to combine scores
#     from different retrieval systems.

#   Query Expansion/Rewriting:
#   - LLM-based Rewriting: Use an LLM to rephrase the user's query in multiple ways,
#     generate synonyms, or decompose complex questions into sub-queries.
#   - Thesaurus/Ontology-based Expansion: Expand query terms using a domain-specific
#     thesaurus or ontology.
#   - Pseudo-Relevance Feedback: Assume top initial results are relevant, extract terms
#     from them, and add these terms to the original query for a second search pass.

#   Handling Large Result Sets & Pagination:
#   - Implement pagination if the number of potential results is very large.
#   - Allow clients to request specific pages of results (e.g., `page=2, page_size=10`).
#   - Consider implications for ranking and relevance across pages.
