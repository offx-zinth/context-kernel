# Summarizer Module (summarizer.py) - The "Mental Note-Taker"

# 1. Purpose of the file/module:
# This module acts as the "Mental Note-Taker" for the ContextKernel. Its primary
# function is to convert raw input text or larger documents into concise, distilled
# summaries or chunked key insights. These summaries can then be used by various
# parts of the system. For example:
#   - The `LLMListener` might use this module to summarize information before
#     storing it in long-term memory (LTM) or the knowledge graph.
#   - The `ContextAgent` might use it to quickly grasp the essence of a long piece
#     of retrieved context before making a decision.
#   - It can help in managing context window limitations for LLMs by providing
#     shorter versions of texts.

# 2. Core Logic:
# The core logic of the Summarizer typically involves:
#   - Receiving Input Text: Takes raw text strings, documents, or potentially URLs
#     pointing to text content.
#   - Pre-processing (Optional): Cleaning the text (e.g., removing HTML tags, irrelevant
#     characters, standardizing whitespace).
#   - Text Chunking (if necessary): If the input text is too long for the chosen
#     summarization model's context window, it needs to be split into smaller, manageable
#     chunks. This might be done by paragraphs, sentences, or fixed token counts.
#   - Summarization Technique Application:
#     - Extractive Summarization: Selecting important sentences or phrases directly
#       from the original text.
#     - Abstractive Summarization: Generating new sentences that capture the essence
#       of the text, often using sequence-to-sequence LLMs.
#   - Iterative Summarization (for chunked text): If the text was chunked, each chunk
#     is summarized. Then, these individual summaries might be concatenated, or a
#     further summarization step might be applied to summarize the summaries themselves
#     (a "map-reduce" style approach).
#   - Post-processing (Optional): Minor cleaning of the summary, ensuring coherence,
#     or attempting to verify factual consistency (a very challenging task).
#   - Outputting Summaries: Returning the final summary or list of summary chunks.

# 3. Key Inputs/Outputs:
#   - Inputs:
#     - Raw Text: A string containing the text to be summarized.
#     - Document(s): Could be file paths or objects representing documents.
#     - Configuration for Summarization:
#       - `desired_length` or `length_ratio` (e.g., percentage of original text).
#       - `style` (e.g., "extractive", "abstractive", "bullet_points").
#       - `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap` (if chunking is used).
#       - Specific model to use.
#   - Outputs:
#     - Summarized Text: A string containing the summary.
#     - List of Summary Chunks: If the input was chunked and processed iteratively,
#       this might be a list of strings, each being a summary of a chunk.
#     - (Potentially) Metadata about the summarization process (e.g., original length,
#       summary length, time taken).

# 4. Dependencies/Needs:
#   - LLM Models: For abstractive summarization (e.g., BART, T5, Pegasus, GPT-family).
#     Access via APIs (OpenAI, Cohere) or local Hugging Face Transformers.
#   - NLP Libraries:
#     - For text processing, tokenization, sentence splitting (e.g., NLTK, spaCy).
#     - For specific extractive methods (e.g., Gensim for TextRank, Sumy).
#   - Tokenizers: Specifically, the tokenizer corresponding to the LLM being used,
#     to accurately count tokens for chunking and context window management.

# 5. Real-world solutions/enhancements:

#   Summarization Libraries & Models:
#   - Hugging Face Transformers:
#     - `summarization` pipeline: Easy-to-use interface.
#       (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.SummarizationPipeline)
#     - Specific Models:
#       - BART (`facebook/bart-large-cnn`): Good for general abstractive summarization.
#       - T5 (`t5-small`, `t5-base`, `t5-large`): Text-to-text model, versatile.
#       - Pegasus (`google/pegasus-xsum`): Pre-trained on extreme summarization.
#       - LongT5, LED: Models designed to handle longer context windows.
#   - Gensim: `gensim.summarization.summarize` (TextRank algorithm for extractive).
#     (https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/summarization/summariser.html)
#   - Sumy: Library with multiple extractive algorithms (LexRank, Luhn, LSA, TextRank).
#     (https://pypi.org/project/sumy/)
#   - Langchain: Provides tools and chains for summarization, especially useful for
#     handling long documents with strategies like "map_reduce", "refine", "stuff".
#     (https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/summarization)

#   Summarization Techniques:
#   - Extractive Summarization:
#     - Pros: Preserves factual accuracy (as it uses original sentences), faster.
#     - Cons: Can be less coherent, may not capture overall meaning as well as abstractive.
#     - Use Cases: Legal documents, news articles where exact phrasing is important.
#   - Abstractive Summarization:
#     - Pros: More human-like, can be more concise and coherent, better at synthesis.
#     - Cons: Risk of hallucinations or factual inaccuracies, computationally more intensive.
#     - Use Cases: Creating executive summaries, summarizing discussions for quick understanding.

#   Text Chunking Strategies:
#   - By Paragraphs or Sections: Use natural document structure.
#   - By Sentences: Use NLTK (`sent_tokenize`) or spaCy (`doc.sents`) for sentence splitting.
#   - Fixed Token Count: Use a tokenizer (e.g., from Hugging Face) to count tokens and split.
#   - Recursive Character Text Splitter (e.g., in Langchain): Tries to split on a list of characters
#     (e.g., "\n\n", "\n", " ", "") and keeps chunks of similar size.
#   - Overlap: When chunking, it's often good to have some overlap between chunks to ensure
#     context is not lost at the boundaries.

#   Pre-processing:
#   - HTML Removal: Use libraries like `BeautifulSoup` or `html.parser`.
#   - Special Character Removal/Normalization: Using `regex` or custom logic.
#   - Case Normalization (Optional): May or may not be beneficial depending on the model.

#   Post-processing:
#   - Fact Checking: Extremely hard problem, often requires external knowledge bases or human review.
#     Research areas include using LLMs to self-critique or cross-reference with other sources.
#   - Coherence Refinement: Potentially use another LLM call to smooth transitions or improve
#     the flow of concatenated summaries.
#   - Deduplication: Remove redundant sentences or phrases from the summary.

#   Configurable Summary Length/Detail:
#   - Allow users or other system components to specify the desired output length (e.g.,
#     number of words/sentences, percentage of original) or level of detail.
#   - Models like T5 can be prompted for different summary lengths.
