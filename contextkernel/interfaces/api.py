# ContextKernel API Interface Module (api.py)

# 1. Purpose of the file/module:
# This module is responsible for exposing the functionalities of the ContextKernel
# system via a web Application Programming Interface (API). It acts as the primary
# entry point for external clients (e.g., web applications, mobile apps, other services)
# to interact with the kernel, for tasks such as sending messages for processing,
# ingesting new information, retrieving context, or managing kernel settings.

# 2. Core Logic:
# The API module typically implements the following logic:
#   - HTTP Request Handling: Receiving incoming HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
#   - Routing: Mapping request URLs (endpoints) to specific handler functions or methods.
#   - Request Validation & Deserialization: Validating the structure and data types of
#     incoming request payloads (e.g., JSON bodies, query parameters) and converting
#     them into Python objects that the core kernel logic can understand.
#   - Core Logic Invocation: Calling the appropriate functions or methods within the
#     ContextKernel's core components (e.g., ContextAgent, LLMListener, LLMRetriever)
#     to perform the requested action.
#   - Response Serialization: Taking the results from the core logic and converting them
#     into a suitable HTTP response format (usually JSON).
#   - Error Handling: Gracefully catching exceptions from the core logic or within the
#     API layer itself and returning appropriate HTTP error responses.
#   - Authentication & Authorization (Optional but Recommended): Verifying the identity
#     of the client and checking if they have permission to access the requested resource
#     or perform the action.

# 3. Key Inputs/Outputs:
#   - Inputs (typically as HTTP requests):
#     - Request Method: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
#     - Endpoint URL: e.g., `/chat`, `/ingest`, `/context/{context_id}`.
#     - Headers: Containing metadata like `Content-Type`, `Authorization`.
#     - Query Parameters: For GET requests, e.g., `/search?query=ai&limit=10`.
#     - Request Body: Often JSON payloads for POST/PUT requests, e.g.,
#       `{"message": "Hello, Kernel!", "user_id": "user123"}` for a `/chat` endpoint.
#       `{"source_url": "http://example.com/doc1", "data": "..."}` for an `/ingest` endpoint.
#   - Outputs (typically as HTTP responses):
#     - Status Code: e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 500 Internal Server Error.
#     - Headers: e.g., `Content-Type: application/json`.
#     - Response Body: Often JSON data, e.g.,
#       `{"reply": "Hello, User!", "context_id": "ctx789"}` for a `/chat` response.
#       `{"status": "success", "document_id": "doc_abc"}` for an `/ingest` response.
#       `{"error": "Invalid input", "details": "..."}` for an error response.

# 4. Dependencies/Needs:
#   - Web Framework: A library for building web applications and APIs (e.g., FastAPI, Flask, Django REST framework).
#   - ContextKernel Core: Access to the main ContextKernel instance or its individual components
#     to delegate the actual processing.
#   - Data Serialization/Validation Libraries: Libraries to define data models and validate/serialize
#     request/response data (e.g., Pydantic when using FastAPI).
#   - (Optional) WSGI/ASGI Server: For running the web application (e.g., Uvicorn for FastAPI/Starlette, Gunicorn for Flask/Django).

# 5. Real-world solutions/enhancements:

#   Web Framework Libraries:
#   - FastAPI: Modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+
#     based on standard Python type hints. Offers automatic data validation (via Pydantic)
#     and OpenAPI/Swagger documentation generation. Excellent for building robust APIs.
#     (https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
#   - Flask: Micro web framework, simple and flexible. Good for smaller to medium-sized APIs.
#     Can be extended with various plugins (e.g., Flask-RESTful, Flask-Pydantic).
#     (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
#   - Django REST framework (DRF): Powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs on top of Django.
#     More batteries-included, suitable for larger projects or when Django ORM is already in use.
#     (https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
#   - Starlette: Lightweight ASGI framework/toolkit, which FastAPI is built upon. Can be used directly
#     for more custom solutions.

#   API Design Best Practices:
#   - RESTful Principles: Use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations.
#     Use nouns for resource URLs (e.g., `/documents`, `/users`).
#   - Versioning: Include API versioning in the URL (e.g., `/api/v1/chat`) or via headers
#     to manage changes without breaking existing clients.
#   - Clear Endpoint Naming: Use intuitive and consistent names for endpoints.
#   - Status Codes: Use HTTP status codes correctly to indicate the outcome of requests.
#   - Richardson Maturity Model: Consider levels of REST maturity for API design.

#   OpenAPI/Swagger:
#   - FastAPI automatically generates an OpenAPI schema and provides Swagger UI (/docs) and ReDoc (/redoc)
#     for interactive API documentation.
#   - For Flask/Django, libraries like `flasgger` or DRF's built-in schema generation can be used.
#   - An OpenAPI specification allows clients to understand and interact with the API without
#     access to source code or additional documentation.

#   Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms:
#   - OAuth2: Standard protocol for authorization. Often used for third-party access.
#     Libraries: `Authlib`, `FastAPI-Users` (for FastAPI).
#   - API Keys: Simple method where clients send a unique key with each request.
#     Can be passed in headers (e.g., `X-API-Key`) or query parameters.
#   - Token-based Authentication (e.g., JWT - JSON Web Tokens): Clients authenticate to get a token,
#     which is then sent with subsequent requests.
#     Libraries: `python-jose`, `PyJWT`, framework-specific JWT libraries.
#   - Basic Authentication: Username/password encoded in the Authorization header. Simple but less secure.
#   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Define roles and permissions to control what authenticated
#     users can do.

#   Logging and Monitoring:
#   - Log API requests, responses, errors, and performance metrics.
#   - Use structured logging (e.g., JSON format) for easier parsing and analysis.
#   - Integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, Sentry for error tracking).
#   - FastAPI/Starlette support middleware for logging.

#   Asynchronous Request Handling:
#   - If ContextKernel operations can be long-running (e.g., complex LLM processing, large data ingestion),
#     use asynchronous programming (`async`/`await` in Python) to prevent blocking the server.
#   - FastAPI is built on ASGI and natively supports `async` operations.
#   - For Flask, you might need an ASGI server like Uvicorn and potentially `async` support via extensions
#     or by running it in a way that handles concurrency (e.g., Gunicorn with worker threads/processes).
#   - Consider background tasks for operations that don't require an immediate response, using
#     task queues like Celery or FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks`.
