# ContextKernel Python SDK Module (sdk.py)

# 1. Purpose of the file/module:
# This module provides a Python Software Development Kit (SDK) for interacting
# programmatically with the ContextKernel. It offers a convenient, Python-native
# interface for developers to integrate ContextKernel functionalities into their own
# applications without needing to make raw HTTP API calls directly (if the SDK
# wraps an API) or manage complex interactions with core components (if it interacts
# directly or offers a higher-level abstraction). The SDK aims to simplify common
# tasks like sending data for processing, querying the kernel's knowledge, and
# configuring its behavior.

# 2. Core Logic:
# The SDK's core logic typically includes:
#   - Client Class(es): A central class (e.g., `ContextKernelClient`) that users
#     instantiate to interact with the kernel. This class manages configuration
#     (like API endpoints, authentication details).
#   - Methods for Kernel Operations: Functions and methods that mirror the
#     functionalities exposed by the ContextKernel (e.g., `chat()`, `ingest_document()`,
#     `retrieve_context()`).
#   - API Call Handling (if wrapping a web API):
#     - Request Formation: Constructing HTTP requests (URL, headers, body) based on
#       method arguments.
#     - Authentication: Automatically including API keys, tokens, or other credentials
#       in requests.
#     - HTTP Communication: Making the actual HTTP calls to the ContextKernel API.
#     - Response Parsing: Processing the HTTP response (e.g., deserializing JSON)
#       into Python objects.
#   - Direct Interaction (if not API-based or for hybrid SDKs): Importing and calling
#     core ContextKernel components directly.
#   - Error Handling: Catching errors (e.g., API errors, network issues, validation
#     errors from the kernel) and mapping them to idiomatic Python exceptions.
#   - Data Marshalling: Converting Python data types and objects into the format
#     expected by the kernel (e.g., JSON for an API) and vice-versa for responses.

# 3. Key Inputs/Outputs:
#   - Inputs (as arguments to SDK methods):
#     - Configuration: API endpoint URL, authentication credentials (API key, token).
#     - Data for Kernel Operations: e.g., text for a chat message, file paths or URLs
#       for document ingestion, search queries for context retrieval.
#     - Parameters: Options to control the behavior of kernel operations (e.g.,
#       `max_results` for a search, `temperature` for LLM generation).
#   - Outputs (as return values from SDK methods or exceptions):
#     - Python Objects: Results from kernel operations, conveniently represented as
#       Python objects, dictionaries, or custom classes (e.g., a `ChatMessage` object,
#       a list of `Document` objects).
#     - Python Exceptions: Custom exceptions representing errors encountered during
#       interaction with the kernel (e.g., `APIError`, `AuthenticationError`,
#       `ResourceNotFoundError`).

# 4. Dependencies/Needs:
#   - HTTP Client Library (if wrapping a web API): A library to make HTTP requests.
#     - `requests`: Popular, synchronous HTTP library.
#     - `httpx`: Modern HTTP client supporting both synchronous and asynchronous operations.
#   - Core ContextKernel Components (if interacting directly or for a server-side SDK):
#     Direct imports from other parts of the `contextkernel` package.
#   - (Optional) Data Serialization/Validation Libraries: Like Pydantic, if the SDK
#     needs to enforce strict data models for its inputs/outputs, though often this
#     is handled by the API itself.

# 5. Real-world solutions/enhancements:

#   Libraries for Building SDKs:
#   - `requests`: For synchronous HTTP calls. Its `Session` object is useful for
#     connection pooling and persistent settings (like headers).
#     (https://requests.readthedocs.io/)
#   - `httpx`: For both synchronous and asynchronous HTTP calls. A good choice if
#     the applications using the SDK might be async.
#     (https://www.python-httpx.org/)

#   SDK Design Best Practices:
#   - Ease of Use:
#     - Intuitive Method Names: Clearly named methods that reflect their purpose.
#     - Clear Parameter Expectations: Well-defined parameters with type hints and
#       sensible defaults.
#     - Minimal Setup: Easy initialization of the client.
#   - Comprehensive Documentation:
#     - Docstrings: Detailed docstrings for all classes and methods (e.g., Google or NumPy style).
#     - Examples: Usage examples for common scenarios.
#     - README: A good README file with installation and quick-start guides.
#     - Generated Documentation: Tools like Sphinx can generate HTML documentation from docstrings.
#   - Authentication:
#     - Secure Handling: Methods for users to provide API keys/tokens securely (e.g.,
#       via constructor, environment variables, or dedicated auth methods). Avoid hardcoding.
#   - Error Handling:
#     - Custom Exceptions: Define a hierarchy of custom exceptions that inherit from
#       a base SDK exception. This allows users to catch specific errors.
#     - Informative Messages: Error messages should be clear and helpful.
#   - Versioning:
#     - SDK Versioning: Follow semantic versioning (SemVer) for the SDK package.
#     - API Version Compatibility: Design the SDK to be compatible with specific API
#       versions, or allow users to specify the API version.
#   - Session Management:
#     - Use `requests.Session` or `httpx.Client` to reuse TCP connections, which can
#       improve performance for multiple calls to the same host.
#   - Idempotency: Where applicable, design methods to be idempotent if they wrap
#     API calls that support it.
#   - Configuration: Allow configuration via parameters, environment variables, or
#     configuration files.

#   Packaging and Distribution:
#   - `pyproject.toml` and `setup.cfg` (or `setup.py`): Standard Python packaging files.
#   - PyPI (Python Package Index): Distribute the SDK as a package on PyPI so users
#     can install it via `pip install contextkernel-sdk` (example name).
#   - Include a license file (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).

#   CLI (Command Line Interface) as part of the SDK:
#   - If a CLI is desired for users to interact with the kernel from the terminal,
#     it can be built as part of the same package or as a separate one.
#   - Libraries:
#     - `click`: A popular library for creating command-line interfaces.
#       (https://click.palletsprojects.com/)
#     - `typer`: Built on top of Click, uses Python type hints to define CLI parameters,
#       similar to FastAPI. (https://typer.tiangolo.com/)
#     - `argparse`: Standard library module for parsing command-line arguments.
