# ContextKernel Main Application Entry Point (main.py)

# 1. Purpose of the file/module:
# This file serves as the main entry point for the ContextKernel application.
# It is responsible for initializing and orchestrating all the necessary components
# of the system, loading configurations, setting up logging, and potentially
# starting services like a web API server (if `interfaces.api` is used) or
# launching a Command Line Interface (CLI) if that's how the kernel is intended
# to be interacted with. It ties together the core logic, memory systems, and
# interfaces into a runnable application.

# 2. Core Logic:
# The typical sequence of operations when this script is executed includes:
#   - Configuration Loading: Reading settings from configuration files (e.g., YAML, .env),
#     environment variables, or command-line arguments. This includes database URIs,
#     API keys, LLM model choices, service ports, etc.
#   - Logging Setup: Initializing the logging system (e.g., setting log levels,
#     handlers for console/file output, formatting).
#   - Argument Parsing (if applicable): If the application can be run with different
#     modes or configurations via command-line flags (e.g., `run_api_server`,
#     `run_cli_tool`, `ingest_data --source <path>`), these arguments are parsed here.
#   - Component Instantiation: Creating instances of the main `ContextKernel` class
#     (if one exists as an orchestrator) or its individual core components like
#     `ContextAgent`, memory systems (`STM`, `LTM`, `GraphDB`, `RawCache`), and
#     any necessary LLM clients or interface handlers.
#   - Dependency Injection/Wiring: Ensuring that components are correctly wired
#     together (e.g., the ContextAgent gets references to the memory systems it needs).
#   - Service Initialization & Startup (if applicable):
#     - If an API server is part of the application (e.g., using FastAPI from
#       `interfaces.api`), this script would configure and start the ASGI/WSGI server
#       (e.g., Uvicorn, Gunicorn).
#     - If a CLI is provided, this script would dispatch to the appropriate CLI command handler.
#   - Application Loop / Main Task Execution: For some types of applications, this might
#     involve starting a main processing loop or a specific task.
#   - Graceful Shutdown: Implementing handlers to shut down services cleanly on receiving
#     signals like SIGINT (Ctrl+C) or SIGTERM.

# 3. Key Inputs/Outputs:
#   - Inputs:
#     - Configuration Files: e.g., `config.yaml`, `.env` files.
#     - Environment Variables: For sensitive data like API keys or to override file configs.
#     - Command-Line Arguments: To specify operational modes, configuration paths, etc.
#       (e.g., `python main.py --config my_config.yaml serve_api --port 8000`).
#   - Outputs:
#     - Running Application/Service: A live API server, an interactive CLI session,
#       or a batch process executing its task.
#     - Log Outputs: To console, files, or external logging systems, detailing the
#       application's activity, warnings, and errors.
#     - Console Messages: Status updates, results (for CLI tools), or error messages.
#     - (Potentially) Exit Codes: Indicating success or failure for script-like operations.

# 4. Dependencies/Needs:
#   - All major components of the ContextKernel:
#     - `core_logic` (ContextAgent, LLMListener, LLMRetriever)
#     - `memory_system` (STM, LTM, GraphDB, RawCache)
#     - `interfaces` (API, SDK, or CLI handlers)
#   - Configuration Utilities: Libraries or custom code for loading and managing config.
#   - Logging Libraries: e.g., Python's built-in `logging`.
#   - Argument Parsing Libraries (if CLI): e.g., `argparse`, `click`, `typer`.
#   - ASGI/WSGI Server (if API): e.g., `uvicorn`, `gunicorn`.
#   - (Potentially) Dependency Injection Framework.

# 5. Real-world solutions/enhancements:

#   Libraries for CLI Argument Parsing:
#   - `argparse`: Part of the Python standard library. Robust and flexible.
#     (https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html)
#   - `click`: Declarative and compositional, makes creating beautiful CLIs easy.
#     (https://click.palletsprojects.com/)
#   - `typer`: Built on Click, uses Python type hints for CLI parameters, similar to FastAPI.
#     (https://typer.tiangolo.com/)

#   Configuration Management Libraries:
#   - Pydantic: Primarily for data validation, but its `BaseSettings` class is excellent
#     for loading settings from environment variables and .env files, with type checking.
#     (https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/settings/)
#   - Dynaconf: Manages settings from various sources (files, env vars, vaults) with layering.
#     (https://www.dynaconf.com/)
#   - Hydra: Framework for elegantly configuring complex applications, especially popular
#     in research and ML projects. (https://hydra.cc/)
#   - `python-dotenv`: Simple library to load environment variables from `.env` files.

#   Dependency Injection Frameworks or Patterns:
#   - `python-dependency-injector`: A popular framework for managing dependencies in Python.
#     (https://python-dependency-injector.ets-labs.org/)
#   - Manual Dependency Injection: Passing dependencies as arguments to constructors or methods.
#     Simpler for smaller projects but can become cumbersome for larger ones.
#   - Service Locators: A pattern where a central registry provides access to services/components.

#   Structured Logging Libraries:
#   - `structlog`: Enhances Python's standard logging with structured output (e.g., JSON),
#     making logs easier to parse, search, and analyze, especially in production.
#     (https://www.structlog.org/)
#   - Standard `logging` with custom `JSONFormatter`.

#   Process Managers for Production (if running as a service):
#   - Gunicorn: WSGI HTTP server for Python web applications (Flask, Django).
#   - Uvicorn: ASGI server, often used with FastAPI and Starlette, can also run Gunicorn workers.
#   - Supervisor: A client/server system that allows its users to monitor and control a number
#     of processes on UNIX-like operating systems.
#   - systemd: An init system and service manager for Linux, widely used to manage daemons.
#   - Docker: For containerizing the application, which then can be managed by orchestrators
#     like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.

#   Graceful Shutdown Mechanisms:
#   - Use `signal` module in Python to catch `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) and `SIGTERM`.
#   - In API servers (FastAPI, Flask), frameworks often provide hooks for startup and shutdown events
#     where resources can be cleaned up (e.g., database connections).
#   - Ensure background threads or processes are properly joined or terminated.

# Example (Conceptual - if using FastAPI and Uvicorn):
# ```python
# import uvicorn
# from contextkernel.interfaces.api import app as fastapi_app # Assuming your FastAPI app is named 'app'
# from contextkernel.core_logic.kernel_config_loader import load_config # Fictional config loader
# from contextkernel.core_logic.kernel_builder import Kernel # Fictional Kernel class

# def main():
#     config = load_config("path/to/config.yaml")
#     # kernel_instance = Kernel(config) # Initialize your main kernel/components
#     # setup_logging(config.logging_settings)
#
#     # Make kernel_instance or its components available to the FastAPI app
#     # This can be done via app state, dependency injection, or global (less ideal)
#     # fastapi_app.state.kernel = kernel_instance
#
#     if config.server.enabled:
#         uvicorn.run(
#             fastapi_app,
#             host=config.server.host,
#             port=config.server.port,
#             log_level=config.server.log_level.lower()
#         )
#     else:
#         # Potentially run a CLI or other mode
#         print("Server not enabled in config. Exiting.")

# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     main()
# ```

# Placeholder for main.py
print("main.py loaded")
