# Graph Indexer Module (contextkernel.memory_system.graph_indexer)
#
# Purpose of the file/module:
# This module is responsible for constructing, updating, and maintaining a semantic graph
# representation of information. Its key roles include:
# 1. Creating nodes (representing entities, concepts, documents, etc.) and edges
#    (representing relationships between nodes) in a graph database.
# 2. Generating vector embeddings for textual content associated with nodes or edges,
#    which can be used for semantic search and similarity calculations within the graph.
# 3. Indexing these embeddings in conjunction with the graph structure to allow for
#    efficient retrieval and complex queries that combine graph traversal and semantic similarity.
# 4. Keeping the graph and its associated indexes up-to-date as new information arrives
#    or existing information changes.

# Core Logic:
# The Graph Indexer typically operates as follows:
# 1. Receives data to be indexed: This could be structured data (like entities and their
#    relationships from an NER process) or unstructured text (like documents or summaries).
# 2. Processes input data: Extracts or identifies entities, relationships, and textual content.
# 3. Generates Embeddings: For relevant textual content (e.g., node descriptions, document text),
#    it uses an embedding model to create dense vector representations.
# 4. Graph Update:
#    - Creates or updates nodes in the graph database for the identified entities/concepts.
#      Node properties might include text, metadata, and the generated embedding.
#    - Creates or updates edges to represent the relationships between these nodes.
#      Edge properties might describe the nature of the relationship.
# 5. Indexing Embeddings: Stores the generated embeddings in a way that they can be
#    efficiently searched (e.g., in a vector index that's linked to the graph nodes).
#    Some graph databases have built-in vector indexing capabilities.
# 6. Manages schema and consistency of the graph data.

# Key Inputs/Outputs:
# - Inputs:
#   - Processed data from other components (e.g., extracted entities and relationships from
#     an NLP pipeline, summaries, raw documents).
#   - Configuration for graph connection, embedding models, indexing strategies.
#   - Commands for updating or deleting graph elements.
# - Outputs:
#   - Status of indexing operations (e.g., success, failure, logs).
#   - Updates to the graph database (new/modified nodes and edges).
#   - Updates to any associated vector indexes.
#   - (Potentially) Notifications or events indicating graph updates.

# Dependencies/Needs:
# - Graph Database: Access to a graph database system (e.g., Neo4j, TigerGraph, Amazon Neptune, ArangoDB).
#   This includes client libraries and connection credentials.
# - Embedding Models: Access to models for generating vector embeddings (local or API-based).
# - Data Sources: The components or systems that provide the data to be indexed.
# - Schema Definition: A clear understanding or definition of the graph schema (node labels,
#   edge types, properties) to ensure consistency.

# Real-world solutions/enhancements:

# Libraries for creating and updating graph structures:
# - Graph Database Client Libraries:
#   - `neo4j-driver`: Official Python driver for Neo4j. (https://neo4j.com/developer/python/)
#   - `pyTigerGraph`: Python driver for TigerGraph. (https://docs.tigergraph.com/pytigergraph/)
#   - `gremlinpython`: For graph databases supporting Apache TinkerPop Gremlin (e.g., JanusGraph, Neptune).
#     (https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#gremlin-python)
#   - `arangopipe`: Python client for ArangoDB.
# - NetworkX: Primarily for in-memory graph creation, analysis, and manipulation. Useful for
#   prototyping or pre-processing before loading into a persistent graph DB.
#   (https://networkx.org/)

# Embedding generation libraries:
# - Sentence Transformers: Popular library for high-quality sentence and text embeddings.
#   (https://www.sbert.net/)
# - Hugging Face Transformers: Can be used to get embeddings from various pre-trained models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa).
#   Requires pooling strategies to get sentence/document level embeddings from token embeddings.
#   (https://huggingface.co/transformers/)
# - OpenAI Embeddings API: Service for generating embeddings (e.g., `text-embedding-ada-002`).
# - Cohere Embed API: Service for generating embeddings with a focus on multilingual and domain-specific capabilities.
# - spaCy: Can provide word vectors or sentence embeddings through `doc.vector` if a model with vectors is loaded.

# Workflow for indexing:
# - Batch Processing: Periodically collect data and index it in large batches. Suitable for
#   less time-sensitive data or initial bulk loading.
# - Real-time/Streaming Updates: Index data as it arrives, ensuring the graph is always (or nearly)
#   up-to-date. Requires a more robust and responsive pipeline.
#   - Can use message queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) to decouple data producers from the indexer.
# - Incremental Indexing: Only update parts of the graph that are affected by new or changed data,
#   rather than re-indexing everything.

# Techniques for handling large-scale graph indexing:
# - Distributed Processing: Use frameworks like Apache Spark or Dask to distribute the data
#   processing and embedding generation tasks.
# - Optimized Database Writes: Utilize database-specific bulk loading utilities, batch operations,
#   and appropriate transaction management to speed up graph updates.
# - Asynchronous Operations: Perform non-blocking calls for embedding generation (if using APIs)
#   and database updates to improve throughput.
# - Scalable Embedding Services: If using API-based embeddings, ensure the service can handle
#   the required load. For local models, consider deploying them as scalable microservices.
# - Graph Partitioning/Sharding: For extremely large graphs, consider strategies to partition
#   the graph across multiple database instances (complex, depends on DB capabilities).
# - Efficient Data Structures: Use appropriate data structures in the indexing pipeline to
#   manage data before it's written to the graph.

#         query = f"CREATE (n:{node_label} $props)"
#         tx.run(query, props=properties)
#
#     # Add methods for adding edges, batch operations, etc.
