# Long-Term Memory (LTM) Interface Module (ltm.py)

# 1. Purpose of the file/module:
# This module implements the Long-Term Memory (LTM) component of the ContextKernel.
# Its primary role is to store, manage, and retrieve information that needs to persist
# across sessions and interactions. The LTM typically stores larger volumes of data,
# often in the form of text chunks, documents, or other data artifacts, along with their
# corresponding vector embeddings. Retrieval is primarily achieved through semantic
# (vector) similarity search, allowing the kernel to recall relevant past information
# based on the meaning of a query, rather than just keyword matches.

# 2. Core Logic:
# The LTM module usually encapsulates the following functionalities:
#   - Connection Management: Establishing and managing connections to a persistent
#     storage backend, most commonly a vector database or a document database with
#     vector search capabilities.
#   - Data Upsertion (Insertion/Update): Handling the storage of new information. This involves
#     taking data chunks (e.g., text, metadata) and their pre-computed vector embeddings,
#     and indexing them in the vector database. It might also involve generating embeddings
#     if not provided.
#   - Querying: Receiving a query vector (embedding of a search query) and performing
#     a similarity search (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors, Approximate Nearest Neighbors)
#     against the stored embeddings in the database.
#   - Filtering: Allowing queries to be constrained by metadata associated with the
#     stored chunks (e.g., source, timestamp, user ID, specific tags).
#   - Data Retrieval: Fetching the original data chunks (and their metadata) corresponding
#     to the most similar vectors found during the search.
#   - (Optional) Deletion and Maintenance: Methods for removing or updating outdated
#     information, and potentially for re-indexing or optimizing the database.

# 3. Key Inputs/Outputs:
#   - Inputs:
#     - For Storage (Upsertion):
#       - Data Chunks: The actual content to be stored (e.g., text snippets, document excerpts).
#       - Vector Embeddings: Dense vector representations of the data chunks.
#       - Metadata: Additional information associated with each chunk (e.g., IDs, source URLs,
#         creation dates, user context, keywords).
#     - For Retrieval (Querying):
#       - Query Vector: An embedding representing the search query.
#       - Top-k: The number of most relevant items to retrieve.
#       - Filters: Conditions on metadata to narrow down the search space.
#   - Outputs:
#     - Query Results: A list of relevant data chunks (or their identifiers/references)
#       retrieved from the LTM.
#     - Search Scores: Similarity scores indicating how relevant each retrieved item is
#       to the query vector.
#     - Metadata: The metadata associated with the retrieved chunks.
#     - Status Indicators: Success/failure of operations.

# 4. Dependencies/Needs:
#   - Vector Database Client Libraries: Python SDKs or clients specific to the chosen
#     vector database solution (e.g., `pinecone-client`, `weaviate-client`, `pymilvus`,
#     `chromadb-client`, `qdrant-client`).
#   - Embedding Models (or access to an embedding generation service): If embeddings are
#     not generated upstream (e.g., by the `LLMListener`), the LTM might need to
#     generate them before storage. This implies a dependency on libraries like
#     Sentence Transformers or APIs like OpenAI Embeddings.
#   - Configuration: Connection details for the vector database (API keys, URLs, index names).
#   - Data Schemas: A defined structure for the data and metadata being stored.

#   Strategies for LTM Population and Maintenance:
#   - Batch Indexing: Initially populating the LTM by processing and indexing a large corpus of existing data.
#   - Incremental Updates: Continuously adding new information as it becomes available.
#   - Re-ranking Strategies: Using a more sophisticated model (e.g., a cross-encoder or an LLM)
#     to re-rank the top-k results retrieved from the vector search for improved relevance.
#   - Data Deduplication: Implementing strategies to avoid storing identical or highly similar information multiple times.
#   - Time-to-Live (TTL) / Data Pruning: Policies for expiring or archiving old or irrelevant information.
#   - Regular Re-indexing: Periodically re-building indexes, especially if the underlying embedding models change
#     or if the data distribution shifts significantly.

#   Metadata Filtering and Hybrid Search:
#   - Most modern vector databases allow storing metadata alongside vectors and support filtering
#     queries based on this metadata (e.g., "find documents about 'AI' created after '2023-01-01'").
#   - Hybrid Search: Combining vector similarity search with traditional keyword-based search
#     (e.g., TF-IDF, BM25) to leverage the strengths of both. Some vector DBs offer this natively.

#   Considerations for Scalability and Cost:
#   - Scalability: Choose a solution that can scale with the expected volume of data and query load.
#     Consider distributed architectures for very large datasets.
#   - Cost: Evaluate costs associated with managed services (e.g., data storage, indexing, query units)
#     versus self-hosting (e.g., server infrastructure, maintenance effort).
#   - Embedding Dimensionality: Higher dimensions can capture more nuance but increase storage and computation costs.
#   - Indexing Trade-offs: Different index types (e.g., flat, IVF_FLAT, HNSW) offer different trade-offs
#     between search speed, accuracy, and build time/memory usage.
