# Raw Cache / Immutable Log Storage Module (raw_cache.py)

# 1. Purpose of the file/module:
# This module serves as a storage mechanism for raw, immutable logs or data within
# the ContextKernel's memory system. Its primary function is to capture and persist
# data in its original, unaltered form as it enters the system or is generated by
# various components. This could include raw user inputs, LLM prompts and responses,
# sensor data, system events, or any other piece of information that needs to be
# recorded verbatim for auditing, debugging, replay, or later processing into more
# structured memory tiers (like LTM or Graph DB). The immutability ensures a
# reliable record of events.

# 2. Core Logic:
# The core logic for this module typically involves:
#   - Writing Data: Appending new raw data entries to a persistent store. Each entry
#     might be timestamped and associated with a source or type.
#   - Retrieving Data: Providing methods to fetch raw data, often by a unique ID,
#     a time range, or based on source/type tags. Retrieval is usually for specific
#     records rather than bulk querying for patterns.
#   - Storage Management: Interacting with the underlying storage system, which could
#     be simple file operations (e.g., writing to log files) or interaction with
#     a dedicated blob storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
#   - Immutability Enforcement: Ensuring that once data is written, it is not modified.
#     (This might be a design principle rather than a strict technical enforcement
#     at this module's level, depending on the backend).

# 3. Key Inputs/Outputs:
#   - Inputs:
#     - Raw Data: The content to be stored (e.g., plain text, JSON strings,
#       serialized objects, byte streams).
#     - Metadata: Information about the raw data, such as a timestamp (often generated
#       automatically), source identifier, data type/category, session ID.
#   - Outputs:
#     - Stored Data Record: The raw data as it was stored, possibly with its metadata.
#     - Retrieval Handle/ID: An identifier for the stored record, which can be used
#       for later retrieval.
#     - Status Indicators: Success/failure of write or read operations.

# 4. Dependencies/Needs:
#   - Filesystem Access: If storing logs as local files.
#   - Cloud Storage Client Libraries: If using cloud-based blob storage (e.g., `boto3`
#     for AWS S3, `google-cloud-storage` for GCS, `azure-storage-blob` for Azure).
#   - Configuration: Paths for local storage, or credentials and bucket names for
#     cloud storage.
#   - Serialization/Deserialization Utilities: For handling data formats like JSON.

# 5. Real-world solutions/enhancements:

#   Technologies for Immutable Raw Log Storage:
#   - Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): Highly scalable object storage, often used for logs.
#     Can be configured with versioning and object immutability (Object Lock).
#   - Google Cloud Storage (GCS): Similar to S3, offers durable and scalable object storage.
#   - Azure Blob Storage: Microsoft's object storage solution.
#   - Distributed File Systems (e.g., HDFS - Hadoop Distributed File System): For very large-scale
#     logging in big data ecosystems, though often more complex to manage for this specific use case
#     unless already part of the infrastructure.
#   - Local Filesystem: Simple for smaller applications or development, but requires manual
#     management for backups, scaling, and durability.
#   - Dedicated Logging Services: Services like AWS CloudWatch Logs, Google Cloud Logging, or
#     ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) can store and manage raw logs, though
#     they often come with more features for analysis and searching.

#   Logging Libraries:
#   - Python's `logging` module: Can be configured with `FileHandler` to write logs to files.
#     Custom handlers can be written to send logs to other destinations (e.g., cloud storage).
#     (https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html)
#   - `boto3` (for AWS S3): To programmatically upload log data to S3 buckets.
#     (https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html)
#   - `google-cloud-storage` (for GCS): Python client for Google Cloud Storage.
#     (https://pypi.org/project/google-cloud-storage/)
#   - `azure-storage-blob` (for Azure Blob Storage): Python client for Azure Blob Storage.
#     (https://pypi.org/project/azure-storage-blob/)

#   Log Rotation and Archiving Strategies:
#   - Log Rotation: Automatically archiving older log files and starting new ones once
#     they reach a certain size or age. Python's `RotatingFileHandler` or `TimedRotatingFileHandler`
#     can manage this for file-based logs.
#   - Archiving: Moving older logs from primary storage to cheaper, long-term archival storage
#     (e.g., Amazon S3 Glacier, Google Cloud Archive Storage). This is often managed by
#     lifecycle policies in cloud storage services.

#   Data Formats for Raw Logs:
#   - Plain Text: Simple and human-readable, but harder to parse programmatically.
#   - JSON Lines (JSONL): Each line is a valid JSON object. Easy to parse, widely supported.
#     Good for structured logs where each entry is self-contained.
#   - CSV/TSV: Suitable for tabular log data.
#   - Parquet or Avro: Columnar storage formats, efficient for large-scale structured logging
#     and analytics, especially in big data pipelines.
#   - Binary Formats (e.g., Protocol Buffers): For performance-critical applications, can be
#     more compact and faster to serialize/deserialize.

#   Data Lifecycle Management:
#   - Define retention policies: How long raw logs need to be kept in active storage.
#   - Tiered Storage: Automatically move data to less expensive storage tiers as it ages
#     and becomes less frequently accessed (a common feature in cloud storage services).
#   - Deletion Policies: Securely deleting logs after their retention period if they are
#     no longer needed, in compliance with data privacy regulations.
