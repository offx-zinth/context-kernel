# ContextKernel Configuration Management Module (config.py)

# 1. Purpose of the file/module:
# This module is dedicated to managing all configuration settings for the
# ContextKernel application. Its responsibilities include loading settings from
# various sources (e.g., files, environment variables), validating their types
# and values, handling default settings, and providing a structured and easily
# accessible way for other modules within the application to retrieve these
# configurations. This centralization of configuration management helps in
# maintaining consistency and simplifies updates or changes to settings.

# 2. Core Logic:
# The core logic for configuration management typically involves:
#   - Source Prioritization: Defining an order of precedence for loading configurations.
#     For example, environment variables might override settings from a YAML file,
#     which in turn might override default values coded into the application.
#   - Configuration Loading:
#     - Reading from files (e.g., `config.yaml`, `settings.toml`, `.env`).
#     - Fetching environment variables.
#   - Default Value Handling: Providing sensible default values for settings that are
#     not explicitly defined in any configuration source.
#   - Validation:
#     - Type Checking: Ensuring that configuration values are of the expected type
#       (e.g., integer, string, boolean, list).
#     - Required Fields: Verifying that mandatory settings are present.
#     - Value Constraints: Checking if values fall within acceptable ranges or options.
#       (Libraries like Pydantic are excellent for this).
#   - Structuring and Access: Presenting the loaded configuration in a structured
#     manner, often as a nested object or dictionary, that other parts of the
#     application can easily query. This might be a singleton configuration object
#     or a globally accessible settings instance.
#   - (Optional) Merging: Combining configurations from multiple sources.

# 3. Key Inputs/Outputs:
#   - Inputs:
#     - Configuration File Paths: Location of files like `config.yaml`, `.env`.
#     - Environment Variables: Accessed directly from the operating system environment.
#     - (Potentially) Command-line arguments that specify config paths or override settings.
#   - Outputs:
#     - A (typically singleton) Configuration Object/Dictionary: This object holds all
#       the application settings in a structured, validated, and readily usable format.
#       For example, `config.database.url` or `config.llm.api_key`.

# 4. Dependencies/Needs:
#   - Parsing Libraries:
#     - `PyYAML`: For parsing YAML files (if YAML is used).
#     - `toml`: For parsing TOML files (if TOML is used).
#     - `python-dotenv`: For loading key-value pairs from `.env` files into environment variables.
#   - Data Validation & Settings Management (Highly Recommended):
#     - Pydantic: Uses Python type hints to define data schemas and perform validation.
#       Its `BaseSettings` class is particularly useful for loading from environment
#       variables and .env files.
#   - Standard Library: `os` module (for environment variables), `pathlib` (for paths).

# 5. Real-world solutions/enhancements:

#   Libraries for Configuration Management:
#   - Pydantic (`BaseSettings`): Ideal for defining typed configuration schemas that
#     automatically load from environment variables, .env files, and can validate data.
#     (https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/settings/)
#   - `python-dotenv`: Specifically for loading `.env` files. Often used in conjunction
#     with other libraries or manual environment variable access.
#     (https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
#   - `PyYAML`: For YAML file parsing. (https://pyyaml.org/)
#   - `toml`: For TOML file parsing. (https://pypi.org/project/toml/)
#   - Dynaconf: A comprehensive settings management library for Python, supporting multiple
#     file formats, environment variables, Vault, and hierarchical merging.
#     (https://www.dynaconf.com/)
#   - Hydra (by Facebook Research): Powerful framework for configuring complex applications,
#     particularly useful for research and machine learning projects. Supports composition
#     and overrides. (https://hydra.cc/)
#   - `configparser`: Standard library module for INI file format.

#   Best Practices for Configuration Management:
#   - Multiple Environments: Structure configurations to easily switch between
#     environments (e.g., `development`, `testing`, `staging`, `production`). This can be
#     achieved with separate files, sections in a file, or environment variable prefixes.
#     (e.g., `APP_ENV=production python main.py`)
#   - Hierarchical Configuration: Allow global default settings to be overridden by more
#     specific configurations (e.g., environment-specific settings override global,
#     user-specific settings override environment).
#   - Secrets Management:
#     - Environment Variables: Store secrets like API keys, database passwords in environment
#       variables, not in version-controlled config files. Use `.env` files for local
#       development only (and ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`).
#     - Secrets Management Tools: For production, use dedicated tools like HashiCorp Vault,
#       AWS Secrets Manager, Google Cloud Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault.
#       Dynaconf has integrations for some of these.
#   - Configuration Schema: Define a clear schema for your configuration (Pydantic excels here).
#     This serves as documentation and ensures that all necessary settings are present
#     and correctly typed before the application starts.
#   - Centralized Access: Provide a single, well-defined way for application components
#     to access configuration values.
#   - Read-Only at Runtime: Once loaded, configuration should generally be treated as immutable
#     during the application's runtime to avoid unpredictable behavior.
#   - Reloadable Configuration (for long-running services): For some services, it might be
#     necessary to reload configuration without restarting. This requires careful design
#     and is not always trivial. Libraries like Dynaconf might offer some support.
#   - Comments in Config Files: Encourage comments in human-readable config files (like YAML/TOML)
#     to explain what different settings do.

# Example using Pydantic for typed settings:
# ```python
# from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings, SettingsConfigDict
# from typing import Optional

# class DatabaseSettings(BaseSettings):
#     url: str = "sqlite:///./default.db"
#     username: Optional[str] = None
#     password: Optional[str] = None

# class LLMSettings(BaseSettings):
#     api_key: str # Required, will raise error if not found
#     model: str = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
#     temperature: float = 0.7

# class AppSettings(BaseSettings):
#     model_config = SettingsConfigDict(env_file='.env', env_nested_delimiter='__')

#     db: DatabaseSettings = DatabaseSettings() # Nested settings
#     llm: LLMSettings = LLMSettings()
#     debug_mode: bool = False

# # Usage:
# # config = AppSettings()
# # print(config.db.url)
# # print(config.llm.api_key)
# # print(config.debug_mode)
# ```

# Placeholder for config.py
print("config.py loaded")
