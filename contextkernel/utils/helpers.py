# ContextKernel Utility Helpers Module (helpers.py)

# 1. Purpose of the file/module:
# This module is intended to house miscellaneous utility functions that are used
# across multiple parts of the ContextKernel application. The goal is to promote
# code reuse, reduce redundancy, and keep common, small-scale logic separate from
# the core business logic of specific components. These helpers should be generic
# enough to be applicable in various contexts within the application.

# 2. Core Logic:
# The core logic will vary greatly depending on the specific helper functions implemented.
# Examples of what might be included:
#   - Text Processing Utilities: e.g., functions for cleaning text, token counting (basic),
#     generating slugs, simple string manipulations not covered by built-ins.
#   - Data Transformation Functions: e.g., converting data structures, normalizing data,
#     generating unique IDs (UUIDs), simple hashing.
#   - Date/Time Helpers: e.g., consistent timestamp generation, date parsing/formatting
#     wrappers if specific formats are used frequently.
#   - File System Helpers: e.g., ensuring a directory exists, reading/writing small
#     files if not covered by more specific modules.
#   - Validation Helpers: Simple validation functions that might be too small for
#     dedicated Pydantic models but are used in multiple places.

# 3. Key Inputs/Outputs:
# This will be specific to each helper function.
#   - Inputs: Arguments required by the helper function.
#   - Outputs: The result of the helper function's operation.

# 4. Dependencies/Needs:
#   - Typically, helper functions should rely on standard Python libraries (`datetime`,
#     `uuid`, `os`, `re`, `json`, etc.) as much as possible to keep them lightweight
#     and broadly applicable.
#   - If specific, small, and well-contained third-party libraries are needed for a
#     particular helper (e.g., a slugify library), they might be acceptable.

# 5. Real-world solutions/enhancements & Best Practices:

#   Function Design and Documentation:
#   - Atomicity: Each helper function should ideally do one thing well.
#   - Purity: Prefer pure functions (output depends only on input, no side effects)
#     where possible, as they are easier to test and reason about.
#   - Clear Naming: Functions should be named descriptively.
#   - Docstrings: All helper functions MUST have clear docstrings explaining their
#     purpose, arguments (including types), return values (including type), and any
#     exceptions they might raise. Use a standard format like Google, NumPy, or
#     reStructuredText.
#   - Type Hinting: Use Python type hints for all function arguments and return values.

#   Organization:
#   - Keep it Flat Initially: Start by adding helpers directly into this file.
#   - Sub-modules: If the number of helper functions grows significantly, consider
#     organizing them into sub-modules within the `utils` directory for better
#     categorization (e.g., `utils/text_helpers.py`, `utils/datetime_helpers.py`).
#     The `helpers.py` file could then potentially import and re-export functions
#     from these sub-modules for a unified access point, or users could import
#     directly from the sub-modules.

#   Testing:
#   - Unit Tests: Every helper function MUST have corresponding unit tests. Given their
#     often small and focused nature, helpers should be easy to test thoroughly.
#     Aim for high test coverage for this module.

#   General Utility Libraries (Consider if a broad category of helpers is needed):
#   - `more_itertools`: Provides additional building blocks, extensions, and recipes
#     for working with Python iterables. (https://pypi.org/project/more-itertools/)
#   - `boltons`: A collection of pure-Python utilities in the spirit of the standard
#     library, covering various areas like data structures, string utils, time utils.
#     (https://boltons.readthedocs.io/)
#   - `python-dateutil`: Offers powerful extensions to the standard `datetime` module,
#     especially for parsing dates in various formats. (https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/)
#   - `shortuuid`: For generating short, unambiguous, URL-safe UUIDs.
#     (https://pypi.org/project/shortuuid/)

# Example of a simple helper function:
# ```python
# import uuid
# from typing import List, Any

# def generate_unique_id() -> str:
#     """Generates a unique identifier using UUID4.

#     Returns:
#         str: A unique ID string.
#     """
#     return str(uuid.uuid4())

# def chunk_list(data: List[Any], chunk_size: int) -> List[List[Any]]:
#     """Splits a list into smaller chunks of a specified size.

#     Args:
#         data (List[Any]): The list to be chunked.
#         chunk_size (int): The size of each chunk.

#     Returns:
#         List[List[Any]]: A list of lists, where each inner list is a chunk.
#                          Returns an empty list if chunk_size is not positive.
#     """
#     if chunk_size <= 0:
#         return []
#     return [data[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(data), chunk_size)]

# ```
